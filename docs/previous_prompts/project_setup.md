The first task is to create a new Next.js project and setup proper local git repo. Then create a new remote github repo and push to github repo. Make sure to use proper gitignore list to avoid bloating only commit neccessary files and folders. And then deploy to
  Amplify using AWS cli. Use proper subagents and mcp servers to accomplish the task effieciently. The end result should be a next.js starter template hosted by AWS amplify (default region). Make sure to not commit sensitive information to github. If you run in to any
  issue, make sure to utilize subagents and/or mcp servers to help with debugging.
