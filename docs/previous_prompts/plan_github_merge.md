Plan a merge with master branch. Refer to git log and analyze related context (especially @docs/ ) . Plan out a 
  non-destructive plan with risk mitigation in mind. The end goal is to deploy the current version to AWS amplify which is 
  already hosted with amplify and once we push the changes to master branch it will get built automatically. So prepare for
   deployment and avoid Type errors and amplify related errors by referring to lessson learned docs provided inside @docs/ 
  folder.
