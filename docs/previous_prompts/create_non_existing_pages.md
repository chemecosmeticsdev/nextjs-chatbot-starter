You are an expert frontend developer, please inspect the dashboard with all its links. The app should not have  404 error
  pages, check all the menu items all the links all the dropdown clickable menu links. At this point there is no need to
  implement everything just put a placeholder for the time being. Refer to @docs for relevant past implementations. Use all
  the available tools (subagents and mcp servers) to help with the tasks. The localhost:3000 is already running, you can
  also use Playwright mcp to login with the credentials (.env.local) and inspect everything visually. Note: the logout
  button should destroy user's session and bring the user back to /login page.
