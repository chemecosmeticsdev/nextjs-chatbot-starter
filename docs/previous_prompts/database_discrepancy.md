I think we need to address this discrepancy. As the app connects to the project defined in 
  .env.local , the name of this project inside Neon dashboard is "cloudshell-chatbot" not 
  "chatbot". While MCP server can have access to all the projects inside my Neon account, 
  accessing/wrinting to the wrong project can cause serious issues. Please recheck and make sure
   to always connect to the correct Neon project either through direct connection or through MCP
   server. Write this to CLAUDE.md to avoid future confusion.
