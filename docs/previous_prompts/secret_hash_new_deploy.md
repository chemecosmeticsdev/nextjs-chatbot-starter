Use playwright mcp to verify that there is no issue. I suspect that we might run into SECRET_HASH issue again. We have 
  encountered this many times and we have report summary on this issue in @docs/cognito-secret-hash-troubleshooting.md . 
  Fix the issue and push it to master again for new build.
