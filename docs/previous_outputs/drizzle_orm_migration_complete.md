ðŸŽ‰ Drizzle ORM Migration Complete!

  I've successfully completed the migration from direct PostgreSQL queries to Drizzle ORM.
  Here's a summary of what was accomplished:

  âœ… Key Achievements:

  1. Fixed the Internal Server Error: The "Save Changes" button that was causing 500 errors
  now works properly with validation
  2. Complete ORM Migration: All database operations now use Drizzle ORM with type safety
  3. SSL Configuration Fixed: Resolved Neon database connection issues
  4. All CRUD Operations Working: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE all function correctly
  5. Admin Settings Fully Functional: All 5 settings load and display properly

  ðŸ”§ Technical Implementation:

  - Drizzle Configuration: drizzle.config.ts with proper PostgreSQL setup
  - Database Schema: Complete type-safe schema in lib/db/schema.ts
  - Connection Management: SSL-enabled connection with pooling in lib/db/connection.ts
  - Service Layer: DrizzleSettingsService replacing old direct SQL approaches
  - API Integration: All routes (/api/v1/settings/*) updated to use Drizzle

  ðŸ“š Documentation Updated:

  - CLAUDE.md: Added database layer architecture guidelines
  - Clear Separation: Drizzle for regular operations, direct SQL only for vector searches
  - Project Structure: Documented the modular lib/db/ organization

  The admin settings system now provides a robust, type-safe foundation for all database
  operations while maintaining the performance benefits of direct SQL for vector similarity
  searches.
