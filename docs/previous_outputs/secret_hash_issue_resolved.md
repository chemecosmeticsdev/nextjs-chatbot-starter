  âœ… Fix Implementation Summary

  Configuration Updates Applied:
  1. next.config.js: Removed COGNITO_CLIENT_SECRET exposure
  2. AWS Amplify Environment Variables: Updated to use correct client ID 7p0uanoj10cg99u2qjpe1np74q without client secret
  3. Git Commit: Pushed fix to master branch (commit 5784219)

  Resolution Strategy:
  - Followed documented troubleshooting guide Option 1 (recommended approach)
  - Eliminated SECRET_HASH requirement by using Cognito client without client secret
  - Maintained all existing authentication logic in lib/cognito.ts

  ðŸš€ Deployment Status

  The AWS Amplify deployment with our SECRET_HASH fix is now live and fully functional. The authentication system works
  correctly without the previous "Client is configured with secret but SECRET_HASH was not received" error.

  Final Verification: âœ… Authentication flows working perfectly on production deployment.
