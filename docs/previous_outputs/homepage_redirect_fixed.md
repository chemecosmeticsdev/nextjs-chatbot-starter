✅ Home Page Redirect Fixed!

  I've resolved the issue with the home page not redirecting to login. Here's what I
  implemented:

  🔧 Solution Applied

  1. Client-Side Redirect Logic - Replaced the static landing page with a client-side
  authentication check
  2. Dual-Layer Protection - Combined middleware + client-side for robust redirection
  3. Loading State - Added proper loading spinner during redirect

  📝 Key Changes Made

  app/page.tsx - Complete rewrite:
  'use client'

  export default function HomePage() {
    // Checks authentication via /api/v1/auth/me
    // Redirects authenticated users to /dashboard
    // Redirects unauthenticated users to /login
    // Shows loading spinner during check
  }

  middleware.ts - Simplified matcher:
  export const config = {
    matcher: ['/', '/dashboard/:path*', '/login'],
  }

  🚀 How It Works Now

  1. User visits http://localhost:3000/
  2. Loading screen appears with "Redirecting..." message
  3. Authentication check via /api/v1/auth/me API
  4. Automatic redirect:
    - ✅ Authenticated → /dashboard
    - ❌ Unauthenticated → /login

  ✅ Build Status

  - TypeScript compilation: Successful ✅
  - Next.js build: Successful ✅
  - Middleware: Working (33.5 kB) ✅

  The home page will now automatically redirect to the login page for unauthenticated users as
   requested! 🎉
