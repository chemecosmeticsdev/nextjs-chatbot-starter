âœ… Critical Database Issue RESOLVED

  ðŸŽ¯ Mission Accomplished - All Issues Fixed!

  âœ… Documentation Updated:

  - Added comprehensive Neon Database Configuration section to CLAUDE.md
  - Clearly specified correct project: "orange-credit-10889790" ("cloudshell-chatbot")
  - Included warning against wrong projects and MCP usage examples
  - Added explicit database schema documentation

  âœ… Data Migration Successful:

  - Migrated all 5 admin settings from wrong project to correct project
  - Preserved all data integrity: values, descriptions, timestamps

  âœ… Database Verification Complete:

  - âœ… Direct SQL connection confirms 5 rows in correct database
  - âœ… MCP connection to correct project returns same data
  - âœ… Both connections now point to same database

  âœ… Admin Settings UI Now Working Perfectly:

  The UI now displays all settings correctly:

  2. âœ… AWS Bedrock Credentials - Shows masked access key "AKIA************QQFZ" and region
  "us-east-1"
  3. âœ… Default LLM Model - Shows "Nova Micro (Amazon â€¢ amazon.nova-micro-v1:0)" with
  description
  4. âœ… S3 Document Bucket - Shows "test-bucket-updated" from migration
  5. âœ… Embedding Model - Shows "amazon.titan-embed-text-v1" (read-only)

  âœ… System Information Panel Confirms Fix:

  - Database Connection: âœ… Connected
  - Settings Count: 5 configured (previously showed 0!)
  - Last Modified: 9/26/2025

  ðŸ”’ Data Integrity Protected:

  - Future MCP operations will use correct project ID

  The admin settings system is now fully operational and correctly connected to the right
  database!
