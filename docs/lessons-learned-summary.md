# Lessons Learned Summary: AWS Amplify Next.js Deployment

## Top 10 Critical Lessons

### 1. **Always Check Disk Space First**
- CloudShell environments are limited (974MB)
- Next.js projects need 2GB+ for safe development
- Use `df -h` before any large npm operations

### 2. **Local Build Must Work Before Cloud Deployment**
- Never skip local build verification
- `npm run build` should succeed locally
- Space constraints forced us to skip this - resulted in multiple cloud failures

### 3. **AWS Amplify Uses Branch-Specific URLs by Default**
- Correct: `https://master.<app-id>.amplifyapp.com`
- Incorrect: `https://<app-id>.amplifyapp.com`
- This confusion caused 25 minutes of false debugging

### 4. **amplify.yml is Required for Next.js Projects**
- Amplify doesn't auto-detect Next.js properly without it
- Must specify `baseDirectory: .next`
- Include proper caching configuration

### 5. **npm ci vs npm install Matters**
- `npm ci` requires package-lock.json
- Use `npm install` if package-lock is missing or excluded
- Production builds are strict about this

### 6. **ESLint Rules Are Stricter in Production**
- Unescaped apostrophes fail: `AWS Bedrock's` ‚Üí `AWS Bedrock&apos;s`
- Local dev might pass, production build fails
- Use HTML entities for special characters in JSX

### 7. **TypeScript Experimental Features Can Break Builds**
- `typedRoutes: true` checks for non-existent routes
- Disable experimental features if not fully implemented
- Production TypeScript checking is more strict

### 8. **Environment Variables Need Proper Management**
- Never commit secrets to git (obvious but happened)
- Use Amplify console for env var management
- GitHub push protection will block secret commits

### 9. **Build Specifications Need Error Handling**
- Include fallback strategies in amplify.yml
- Add echo statements for debugging
- Cache node_modules and .next properly

### 10. **Platform-Specific Behaviors Vary**
- Local success ‚â† cloud success
- Different Node.js versions can cause issues
- Network conditions affect npm installs

## Most Impactful Issues (by time lost)

### 1. Wrong URL Testing (25+ minutes)
- **Impact:** Thought successful deployment was failed
- **Lesson:** Always verify correct URL patterns for the platform
- **Prevention:** Document URL patterns upfront

### 2. Multiple Build Failures (45 minutes total)
- **Impact:** 5 failed deployments before success
- **Lesson:** Comprehensive local testing prevents cloud failures
- **Prevention:** Better pre-deployment checklist

### 3. Space Management Issues (20 minutes)
- **Impact:** Cannot install dependencies or build locally
- **Lesson:** Environment sizing is critical for modern JS projects
- **Prevention:** Use appropriate development environments

## What We Should Have Done Differently

### 1. **Environment Preparation**
```bash
# Should have started with:
df -h                    # Check space
node --version           # Verify Node version
npm --version           # Verify npm version
npm run build           # Test local build
```

### 2. **Configuration First Approach**
- Create amplify.yml before first deployment
- Set up proper gitignore before initial commit
- Configure environment variables in Amplify console first

### 3. **Incremental Testing**
- Deploy minimal "hello world" first
- Add features incrementally
- Test each addition before proceeding

### 4. **Better Debugging Strategy**
- Check correct URL patterns immediately
- Review build logs systematically
- Don't assume platform defaults match expectations

---

## Success Patterns That Worked

### 1. **Systematic Error Resolution**
- Each build failure provided specific error messages
- Fixed one issue at a time
- Maintained commit history of fixes

### 2. **AWS CLI Investigation**
- Used AWS CLI to inspect deployment status
- Retrieved detailed job information
- Understood deployment pipeline stages

### 3. **Specialized Agent Usage**
- Used nextjs-frontend-engineer for project setup
- Used github-devops-engineer for repository management
- Used aws-cli-engineer for deployment configuration
- Used production-debugging-engineer for issue diagnosis

### 4. **Comprehensive Documentation**
- Created detailed commit messages explaining fixes
- Documented each issue and resolution
- Built reusable configuration templates

---

## Key Technical Insights

### 1. **Next.js 14 on AWS Amplify**
- Works excellently once properly configured
- Requires explicit build specification
- SSR/SSG features work out of the box

### 2. **Environment Variable Management**
- AWS Amplify's system is secure and effective
- No secrets exposed in build logs
- Easy to manage through console

### 3. **CI/CD Pipeline Performance**
- Average build time: 2-3 minutes
- Fast failure detection: 1-2 minutes
- Excellent caching capabilities

### 4. **shadcn/ui Integration**
- Works perfectly with Next.js 14
- No additional Amplify configuration needed
- Build process handles Tailwind CSS correctly

## Tools and Commands That Saved Time

### Most Useful AWS CLI Commands
```bash
# Get deployment status
aws amplify list-jobs --app-id <id> --branch-name master --region ap-southeast-1

# Get detailed error info
aws amplify get-job --app-id <id> --branch-name master --job-id <job> --region ap-southeast-1

# Check app configuration
aws amplify get-app --app-id <id> --region ap-southeast-1
```

### Most Useful Local Commands
```bash
# Space management
df -h
du -sh node_modules
npm cache clean --force

# Build verification
npm run build
npm run lint
npx tsc --noEmit
```

### Most Useful Git Commands
```bash
# Remove secrets from commit
git rm --cached .env.local
git commit --amend

# Check what's being tracked
git status
git log --oneline
```

## Final Reflection

This deployment taught us that **preparation and understanding platform-specific behaviors are more important than perfect code**. The application code was solid from the start, but configuration mismatches and environmental assumptions caused the majority of issues.

The most valuable insight: **Modern deployment platforms are powerful but opinionated**. Success comes from aligning with platform conventions rather than fighting them.
