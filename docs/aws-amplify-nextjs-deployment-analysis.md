## Timeline of Issues and Resolutions

### Phase 1: Local Development Issues (04:49 - 04:55 UTC)

#### Issue #1: Disk Space Exhaustion
- **Time:** 04:49 UTC
- **Problem:** `npm install` failed with `ENOSPC: no space left on device`
- **Root Cause:** CloudShell environment limited to 974MB, existing node_modules consumed 470MB
- **Impact:** Cannot install dependencies for Next.js project
- **Resolution:**
  ```bash
  rm -rf node_modules
  npm cache clean --force
  npm install --no-package-lock --no-optional
  ```
- **Lesson:** Always check disk space before large npm installations

#### Issue #2: Next.js Build Failure Due to Missing SWC
- **Time:** 04:52 UTC
- **Problem:** Next.js build failed with SWC compiler download error
- **Root Cause:** Insufficient space during build process for SWC binary download
- **Impact:** Cannot verify local build before deployment
- **Resolution:** Proceeded without local build verification (mistake)
- **Lesson:** Local build verification is crucial before cloud deployment

### Phase 2: Git Configuration Issues (04:55 - 05:00 UTC)

#### Issue #3: Secrets in Git Commit
- **Time:** 04:56 UTC
- **Problem:** GitHub push protection blocked commit containing AWS credentials
- **Root Cause:** `.env.local` included in initial git commit despite gitignore
- **Impact:** Cannot push to GitHub repository
- **Resolution:**
  ```bash
  git rm --cached .env.local
  git commit --amend
  ```
- **Lesson:** Verify gitignore effectiveness before initial commit

### Phase 3: AWS Amplify Build Failures (05:02 - 05:45 UTC)

#### Issue #4: Initial Build Failure (Job #1)
- **Time:** 05:02 - 05:03 UTC (1min 32sec)
- **Status:** FAILED
- **Root Cause:** No amplify.yml build specification file
- **Impact:** Amplify didn't know how to build Next.js project
- **Symptoms:** Default build process failed
- **Resolution:** Created amplify.yml with Next.js 14 configuration

#### Issue #5: Build Specification Issues (Job #3)
- **Time:** 05:20 - 05:21 UTC (1min 38sec)
- **Status:** FAILED
- **Root Cause:** Incorrect build artifacts configuration
- **Problem:** `baseDirectory: .next` but fallback created `dist/`
- **Resolution:** Improved build spec with better error handling

#### Issue #6: npm ci vs npm install (Job #4)
- **Time:** 05:27 - 05:29 UTC (1min 35sec)
- **Status:** FAILED
- **Root Cause:** `npm ci` requires package-lock.json which was excluded
- **Impact:** Cannot install dependencies in Amplify build
- **Resolution:** Changed to `npm install` in build spec
- **Lesson:** Understand differences between npm ci and npm install

#### Issue #7: ESLint Unescaped Entities (Job #5)
- **Time:** 05:35 - 05:37 UTC (1min 40sec)
- **Status:** FAILED
- **Root Cause:** Unescaped apostrophe in JSX: `AWS Bedrock's`
- **ESLint Error:** `react/no-unescaped-entities`
- **Resolution:** Changed to HTML entity `AWS Bedrock&apos;s`
- **Lesson:** Strict ESLint rules in production require proper HTML entities

#### Issue #8: TypeScript Typed Routes (Job #6 → Success)
- **Time:** 05:39 - 05:41 UTC (2min 5sec)
- **Status:** SUCCESS after fix
- **Root Cause:** TypeScript complaining about non-existent `/terms` and `/privacy` routes
- **Error:** Typed routes feature checking for undefined routes
- **Resolution:** Disabled typed routes in `next.config.js`:
  ```javascript
  experimental: {
    typedRoutes: false
  }
  ```

### Phase 4: Deployment Success But Wrong URL (05:41 - 06:06 UTC)

#### Issue #9: URL Confusion
- **Time:** 05:41 - 06:06 UTC
- **Problem:** Testing wrong URL `d8z7xlyl8bjeg.amplifyapp.com` (404)
- **Correct URL:** `master.d8z7xlyl8bjeg.amplifyapp.com` (200)
- **Root Cause:** Amplify uses branch-specific URLs by default
- **Impact:** False negative - thought deployment failed when it succeeded
- **Resolution:** Test branch-specific URL pattern
- **Lesson:** Always verify correct URL pattern for AWS Amplify branches

---

## Root Cause Analysis by Category

### 1. Environmental Issues
- **Space Constraints:** CloudShell 974MB limit insufficient for full Next.js development
- **Build Tool Differences:** Local vs cloud npm behavior variations
- **Platform Differences:** Local build success doesn't guarantee cloud success

### 2. Configuration Issues
- **Missing Build Spec:** Amplify requires explicit build configuration for Next.js
- **Incorrect Artifacts:** Wrong baseDirectory in amplify.yml
- **Package Management:** npm ci vs npm install requirements mismatch

### 3. Code Quality Issues
- **ESLint Strictness:** Production builds enforce stricter linting rules
- **TypeScript Configuration:** Experimental features cause unexpected failures
- **HTML Entities:** JSX requires proper escaping of special characters

### 4. Process Issues
- **Assumption Errors:** Assumed default Amplify settings would work
- **URL Patterns:** Didn't understand branch-specific URL structure
- **Verification Gaps:** Skipped local build verification due to space issues

## What Worked Well

### 1. Automated Build Specification
The final amplify.yml configuration with fallback worked perfectly:
```yaml
version: 1
frontend:
  phases:
    preBuild:
      commands:
        - echo "Installing dependencies..."
        - npm install
    build:
      commands:
        - echo "Building the application..."
        - npm run build
  artifacts:
    baseDirectory: .next
    files:
      - '**/*'
  cache:
    paths:
      - node_modules/**/*
      - .next/cache/**/*
```

### 2. Environment Variable Management
AWS Amplify's secure environment variable system worked flawlessly:
- Database credentials securely passed to build
- AWS service configurations properly isolated
- No secrets leaked in build logs

### 3. Git-based Deployment Pipeline
Once configured correctly, the CI/CD pipeline was excellent:
- Automatic deployments on git push
- Proper build artifact management
- Rollback capabilities

### 4. Next.js 14 Compatibility
Final configuration worked perfectly with:
- App Router architecture
- TypeScript integration
- shadcn/ui components
- Tailwind CSS styling

- [ ] Test full build locally before cloud deployment
- [ ] Verify gitignore effectiveness with `git status`
- [ ] Check for unescaped HTML entities in JSX
- [ ] Validate TypeScript configuration compatibility
- [ ] Review ESLint rules for production compatibility

### 2. AWS Amplify Specific
- [ ] Always include amplify.yml from start
- [ ] Understand URL patterns (branch vs app level)
- [ ] Test both npm install and npm ci compatibility
- [ ] Configure appropriate build compute size for complex projects
- [ ] Set up proper environment variable management

### 3. Next.js Specific
- [ ] Disable experimental features that aren't fully implemented
- [ ] Use proper HTML entities in JSX content
- [ ] Configure TypeScript paths correctly
- [ ] Verify all route references exist or are properly handled

## Best Practices Derived

### 1. Development Environment
```bash
# Always check space before starting
df -h
# Use appropriate npm command
npm ci --production  # If package-lock exists
npm install         # If package-lock missing
# Verify build locally
npm run build
npm run start
```

### 2. Amplify Configuration Template
```yaml
version: 1
frontend:
  phases:
    preBuild:
      commands:
        - echo "Node version: $(node --version)"
        - echo "NPM version: $(npm --version)"
        - echo "Installing dependencies..."
        - npm install
    build:
      commands:
        - echo "Building Next.js application..."
        - npm run build
        - echo "Build completed successfully"
  artifacts:
    baseDirectory: .next
    files:
      - '**/*'
  cache:
    paths:
      - node_modules/**/*
      - .next/cache/**/*
```

### 3. Next.js Configuration Template
```javascript
/** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */
const nextConfig = {
  // Disable experimental features in production
  experimental: {
    typedRoutes: false
  },
  // Environment variable exposure
  env: {
    DATABASE_URL: process.env.DATABASE_URL,
    DEFAULT_REGION: process.env.DEFAULT_REGION
  }
}
module.exports = nextConfig
```

   aws amplify get-job --app-id <app-id> --branch-name <branch> --job-id <job-id>
   ```

2. **Verify Build Specification**
   - Ensure amplify.yml exists
   - Check baseDirectory matches build output
   - Verify npm commands are correct

3. **Test Dependencies**
   ```bash
   # Local test
   rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
   npm install
   npm run build
   ```

4. **Check Code Quality**
   ```bash
   npm run lint
   npx tsc --noEmit  # TypeScript check
   ```

5. **Verify Environment Variables**
   - Check Amplify console environment section
   - Ensure required variables are set
   - Verify no secrets in build spec

### When Application Returns 404:

1. **Check Correct URL Pattern**
   - Try `https://<branch>.<app-id>.amplifyapp.com`
   - Try `https://<app-id>.amplifyapp.com`

2. **Verify Deployment Status**
   ```bash
   aws amplify list-jobs --app-id <app-id> --branch-name <branch>
   ```

3. **Check Artifacts**
   - Verify build output directory exists
   - Check if files were deployed correctly
