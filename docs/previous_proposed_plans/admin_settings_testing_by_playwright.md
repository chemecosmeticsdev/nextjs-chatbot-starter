Playwright Testing Plan for Admin Settings Implementation

    Overview

    Test the complete user journey from login to admin settings verification using the 
    credentials from .env.local.

    Test Flow

    1. Login Page Testing
      - Navigate to localhost:3000/login
      - Fill in login form with super admin credentials:
          - Email: chemecosmetics.dev@gmail.com
        - Password: SuperAdmin123!
      - Verify successful login and redirect to dashboard
    2. Dashboard Navigation
      - Verify dashboard loads correctly after login
      - Navigate to Settings page via dashboard navigation
      - Confirm user role authentication (super_admin access)
    3. Admin Settings Page Testing
      - Verify all 5 admin settings sections are rendered:
          - Mistral OCR API Key configuration
        - AWS Bedrock Credentials (Access Key, Secret Key, Region)
        - Default LLM Model dropdown (populated from Bedrock API)
        - S3 Document Bucket configuration
        - Embedding Model (read-only field)
    4. Interactive Elements Testing
      - Test show/hide toggles for sensitive fields
      - Verify dropdown functionality for LLM model selection
      - Test form validation and error states
      - Verify save button functionality
    5. Visual Documentation
      - Take screenshots at each major step for documentation
      - Capture the complete admin settings interface
      - Document any issues or unexpected behavior

    Success Criteria

    - ✅ Successful login with provided credentials
    - ✅ Dashboard loads and navigation works
    - ✅ Admin settings page loads with all 5 sections
    - ✅ Form elements are interactive and functional
    - ✅ Proper access control (super_admin only)

    This testing will validate the complete implementation from the previous development 
    session and ensure the admin settings system is working as designed.
