Admin Settings Fix with Drizzle ORM Implementation

    ðŸŽ¯ Strategic Approach: Introduce Drizzle ORM

    Current Problem Analysis:

    - Direct PostgreSQL client queries in SystemSettingsService causing 
    connection/serialization issues
    - Complex manual JSON handling and database connection management
    - No type safety or query validation
    - Error-prone manual SQL construction

    Solution: Migrate to Drizzle ORM Architecture

    Phase 1: Drizzle Setup & Configuration

    1. Install Drizzle Dependencies

    npm install drizzle-orm postgres
    npm install -D drizzle-kit @types/pg

    2. Create Drizzle Configuration

    - drizzle.config.ts - Database connection and migration config
    - lib/db/ directory structure for schema and connection
    - Environment-based connection string management

    3. Define Database Schema

    - lib/db/schema.ts - Type-safe schema definitions for:
      - system_settings table with proper JSONB typing
      - users table for authentication
      - activity_logs table for audit trails
    - Proper TypeScript types for all database entities

    Phase 2: Database Layer Refactor

    1. Replace SystemSettingsService

    - Create lib/db/settings.ts with Drizzle-based operations
    - Type-safe CRUD operations using Drizzle's query builder
    - Proper connection pooling and error handling
    - Maintain encryption/masking logic with better type safety

    2. Update API Routes

    - Modify /api/v1/settings/[key]/route.ts to use new Drizzle service
    - Remove manual SQL queries and JSON.stringify issues
    - Add proper transaction support for atomic operations
    - Improve error handling with Drizzle's built-in validations

    3. Database Migrations

    - Create Drizzle migration files for existing schema
    - Ensure compatibility with current data
    - Add proper indexes and constraints through migrations

    Phase 3: Admin Settings Fix

    1. Fix Serialization Issues

    - Use Drizzle's native JSONB support for complex objects
    - Remove double JSON.stringify() calls
    - Proper TypeScript interfaces for settings values

    2. Improve Transaction Handling

    - Wrap multiple setting updates in Drizzle transactions
    - Replace Promise.all() with proper sequential/transactional updates
    - Add rollback support for failed operations

    3. Enhanced Error Handling

    - Leverage Drizzle's query validation and error types
    - Provide specific error messages for different failure modes
    - Add proper logging with structured error information

    Phase 4: Architecture Guidelines

    Database Usage Patterns:

    - âœ… Drizzle ORM: All regular CRUD operations (settings, users, logs)
    - âœ… Direct SQL: Reserved ONLY for vector similarity searches and complex analytics
    - âœ… Type Safety: Full TypeScript integration with database schema
    - âœ… Migrations: Version-controlled schema changes

    Benefits:

    - Type Safety: Compile-time validation of queries and data structures
    - Performance: Connection pooling and optimized query generation
    - Maintainability: Declarative schema and automated migrations  
    - Error Reduction: Eliminates manual SQL construction errors
    - Developer Experience: IntelliSense and auto-completion for database operations

    Implementation Order:

    1. Install and configure Drizzle with existing database
    2. Create schema definitions matching current tables
    3. Replace SystemSettingsService with Drizzle-based implementation
    4. Update API routes to use new service
    5. Test admin settings save functionality
    6. Gradually migrate other database operations to Drizzle

    This approach will solve the immediate admin settings error while establishing a robust, 
    type-safe database layer for the entire application.
