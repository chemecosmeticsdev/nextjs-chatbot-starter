Based on my comprehensive analysis of the dashboard structure and codebase, I can identify the current state and plan
  to fix all 404 errors. Let me complete my research and present the plan.

  From examining the codebase, I found:

  Current Dashboard Structure Analysis

  Existing Pages:
  - /app/page.tsx - Homepage
  - /app/login/page.tsx - Login page
  - /app/about/page.tsx - About page
  - /app/chat/page.tsx - Chat interface
  - /app/dashboard/page.tsx - Main dashboard
  - /app/dashboard/layout.tsx - Dashboard layout with sidebar
  - /app/dashboard/settings/page.tsx - Settings page (super admin only)

  Navigation Menu Items Found in AppSidebar:
  Based on app-sidebar.tsx, the navigation includes:
  1. Dashboard → /dashboard ✅ EXISTS
  2. Chat → /chat ✅ EXISTS
  3. Documents (with subitems):
    - All Documents → /dashboard/documents ❌ MISSING
    - Upload Document → /dashboard/documents/upload ❌ MISSING
  4. Analytics → /dashboard/analytics ❌ MISSING
  5. Chatbots (with subitems):
    - All Chatbots → /dashboard/chatbots ❌ MISSING
    - Create Chatbot → /dashboard/chatbots/create ❌ MISSING
  6. User Management → /dashboard/users ❌ MISSING
  7. System (with subitems):
    - Settings → /dashboard/settings ✅ EXISTS
    - Activity Logs → /dashboard/logs ❌ MISSING

  UserNav Dropdown Items:
  From user-nav.tsx:
  1. Profile → /dashboard/profile ❌ MISSING
  2. Settings → /dashboard/settings ✅ EXISTS (super admin only)
  3. Logout → Functional ✅ EXISTS

  Authentication System:
  - Uses AWS Cognito with super admin credentials: chemecosmetics.dev@gmail.com / SuperAdmin123!
  - Logout functionality calls /api/v1/auth/logout and redirects to /login
  - Session management with JWT tokens

  Missing Pages Identified (7 total):

  1. /dashboard/documents - Documents listing
  2. /dashboard/documents/upload - Document upload
  3. /dashboard/analytics - Analytics dashboard
  4. /dashboard/chatbots - Chatbots management
  5. /dashboard/chatbots/create - Create chatbot
  6. /dashboard/users - User management
  7. /dashboard/profile - User profile
  8. /dashboard/logs - Activity logs


Phase 1: Create Missing Route Structure

    1. Create directory structure for missing routes:
      - /app/dashboard/documents/ (with page.tsx and upload/page.tsx)
      - /app/dashboard/chatbots/ (with page.tsx and create/page.tsx)  
      - /app/dashboard/analytics/page.tsx
      - /app/dashboard/users/page.tsx
      - /app/dashboard/profile/page.tsx
      - /app/dashboard/logs/page.tsx

    Phase 2: Implement Placeholder Pages

    For each missing page, create placeholder components with:
    - Role-based access control (admin/super_admin restrictions)
    - Consistent layout following existing patterns
    - Proper breadcrumb navigation
    - Loading states and error handling
    - shadcn/ui components for consistency
    - Placeholder content indicating "Coming Soon" with appropriate icons

    Phase 3: Visual Testing with Playwright

    1. Install browser dependencies
    2. Login with super admin credentials (chemecosmetics.dev@gmail.com)
    3. Navigate through all menu items systematically:
      - Main navigation items
      - Dropdown submenus  
      - User profile dropdown
    4. Verify no 404 errors occur
    5. Test logout functionality ensures session destruction

    Phase 4: Logout Function Verification

    - Confirm logout destroys session properly
    - Verify redirect to /login page works
    - Test that attempting to access dashboard after logout redirects to login

    Page Templates to Create:

    - Documents: File management interface placeholder
    - Analytics: Charts/metrics dashboard placeholder  
    - Chatbots: Bot management interface placeholder
    - Users: User administration placeholder (super admin only)
    - Profile: User profile management placeholder
    - Logs: Activity logs viewer placeholder (super admin only)

    Role-Based Access:

    - All users: Dashboard, Chat, Profile
    - Admin + Super Admin: Documents, Analytics  
    - Super Admin only: Chatbots, Users, Settings, Logs

    This plan will eliminate all 404 errors while maintaining proper authentication and role-based access control 
    patterns already established in the codebase.
